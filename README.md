Genesis is a revolutionary programming language designed to let you code as naturally as you speak. It ignores "noise words", forgives indentation mistakes, and connects seamlessly to the entire Python ecosystem. **Now with built-in AI, Voice, and Graphics.**

---

## ✨ Features (v5)

- **🧠 AI Inside**: Ask the code anything. `ask "how do I loop?"` -> Real answers.
- **🗣️ Native Voice**: Your code speaks. `speak "I am alive"`
- **🎨 Graphics Engine**: Draw easily. `draw "circle" with 100`
- **📝 Natural Syntax**:
    - `say "Hi" if true` (Postfix logic)
    - `say "Loop" 5 times` (Repetition)
- **🐍 Python Power Bridge**: Use *any* Python library directly.
- **❌ Friendly Errors**: No stack traces. Just clear, human-readable feedback.

## 🚀 Quick Tour

### 1. The "Hello World"
```python
say "Hello, Rubenthampy!"
```

### 2. Variables & Math (The Human Way)
```python
please set the count to 10
update the count to count plus 5
say count
```

### 3. Loop naturally
```python
set i to 0
loop while i is less than 5 do
    say "Counting " plus i
    update i to i plus 1
end
```

### 4. The Python Bridge (CRAZY POWER)
```python
use python "platform"
use python "os"

set os_name to call python platform.system
say "I am running on " plus os_name

# Make your Mac speak!
call python os.system with "say 'Genesis is alive'"
```
