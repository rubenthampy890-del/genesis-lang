Genesis is a revolutionary programming language designed to let you code as naturally as you speak. It ignores "noise words", forgives indentation mistakes, and connects seamlessly to the entire Python ecosystem.

## ✨ Features

- **🗣️ Natural English Syntax**: Write `please set x to 10` or `just say x`. It understands you.
- **🧠 Intelligent Autocomplete**: Built-in REPL with smart suggestions as you type.
- **🐍 Python Power Bridge**: Use *any* Python library directly. `use python "math"` -> `call python math.pi`.
- **❌ Friendly Errors**: No stack traces. Just clear, human-readable feedback.
- **📁 Built-in Examples**: Type `examples` in the shell to run demos like Matrix Rain or Voice Assistant.
