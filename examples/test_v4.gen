say "Testing Genesis v4 (Natural English)"

# 1. Noise Words
# "please", "the", "basically", "just", "now" are ignored.
please set the x to 10
and now basically say the x

# 2. Natural Phrasing
# "to" is required by 'set', but 'the' is noise.
# "set value to 100" -> Tokens: SET VALUE TO 100
set the value to 100
say "The value is:"
say the value

# 3. Flexible Alignment (Not strictly aligned)
check the value is 100 then
    say "It works!"
    say "Indentation is not strict"
    end

# 4. Error Test (Uncomment to test specific error)
# say call unknown_function with 10

say "Done with v4 test."
